# Object Detection

## Introduction
This project is an image processing application that leverages the power of Hugging Face's `transformers` library and PyTorch. The model is trained using the `timm` library and the interface is built with Gradio to provide an interactive web-based experience. The project also uses `pillow` for image processing.
